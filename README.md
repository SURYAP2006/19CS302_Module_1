## DATE:28\04\2025
## AIM:
To write a program to check whether the attendance is PRESENT using simple if statement.

## Algorithm
1. Start. 
2. Declare a variable value of type char. 
3. Prompt the user to enter a value. 
4. Read the value using scanf. 
5. Check whether the attendance is PRESENT. 
6. If true, print "Present". 
7. If false, print " ". 
8. End.  

## Program:

#include<stdio.h>
 
int main(){ 

char p1; 

scanf("%c", &p1);
 
if(p1=='P') 

{ 

printf("Present"); 

} 

return 0; 

}
